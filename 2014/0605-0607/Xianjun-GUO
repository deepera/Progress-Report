Planned target:
1. Coursera : Data Scientist Toolbox Lesson 1
2. Speech Recognition using HMM : 
	First, learn the basic theory of speech recognition and understand how HMM is used in it.  
	Second, find the source code implementing speech recognition that can be successfully run.
	Third, Upload the source code and the specification to my github account.


Actual progress:
1. [100%] Done
2. [90%] Done. It's hard to find the source code that fully implements the whole process of speech recognition using HMM. The best one I can find can output the result of recognized phonemes, which lacks the final step - viterbi algorithm.  

Remarks:
1. The materials about the usage of github is not enough in the cousera course. It would be better to read the documents on github website.
2. The details of the usage of the source code of speech recognition can be found in https://github.com/Daniel945/continuedSpeechRecognition.
