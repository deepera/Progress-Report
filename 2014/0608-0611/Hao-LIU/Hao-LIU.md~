### Planned target:
1. study cuda-convnet
   1.1 trained sample on CIFAR-10 datasets
   1.2 studied cnn layers setting of winner of ILSVRC 2012
2. Week one of Data Scientist's Toolbox (JHU data science series courses)


### Actual progress:
1.  
 1.1 [100%]run successed, learning curve provided in the dir
 1.2 [80%]get the idea of overall setting of Alex Krizhevsky's result

2. [100%] Done


### Remarks:
1. 
  1.1 last time I mis-understand parameters that output.
      Still do not know why the curve fluctuate heavily after 80th epoch.
  1.2 I intend to wirte a layer setting file next step, then maybe I will find something I mis-understand.
