### Planned target:
1. Reading source code of isolatedSpeechRecognition and make a PPT explaining it.
2. Coursera: Data Scientist's Toolbox (Week 2 & 3)

### Actual progress:
1. [90%] I have read the source code and made a PPT. But I think I still not fully understand it. I need to digest.
2. [100%] Done.

### Remarks:
1. I recorded Xiaocheng's and my voice for recognition. But the recognition rate is not perfect and furthermore, I need to manually process the raw voice to decrease the bit rate for the later software processing. So this software is not so perfect.
2. I went hiking for one day.
