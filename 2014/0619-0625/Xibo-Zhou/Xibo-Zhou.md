### Planned target:
1. Cross validation between UFLDL and DeepLearnToolbox: Linear Encoder & CNN
2. Try out deeplearning4j
3. Coursera: R Programming (Week 1 & 2)


### Actual progress:
1.   [60%] Linear Encoder finished, CNN fixing errors & bugs
2.   [10%] Installed the required libraries in our cluster (might be useless)
3.   [100%] Finished

### Remarks:
1.   The deeplearning4j website tutorial only shows how to set up the cluster using AWS (with the assumption that the user is familiar with AWS).
2.   Everything becomes tricky when our cluster is offline.
