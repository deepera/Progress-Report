## Name: Xibo Zhou

### Planned target:
1. Cross validation between UFLDL and DeepLearnToolbox: CNN (debug)
2. Try out deeplearning4j
3. Coursera: R Programming (Week 3)
4. Coursear: Getting and Cleaning Data (Week 1-2)
5. Paper reading:
        Sibyl system
        FTRL online learning

### Actual progress:
1.   [60%] CNN already runable
2.   [0%] 
3.   [100%]
4.   [100%]
5.   [40%] Have read Sibyl system PPT, still not understanding FTRL, surveying relivant papers (RDA, FOBOS, Truncated Gradient...)

### Remarks:
1.   The RGB dimension problem, CNN toolbox is not exactly the same with UFLDL.
2.   Need a lot of knowledge understanding optimization algorithms
