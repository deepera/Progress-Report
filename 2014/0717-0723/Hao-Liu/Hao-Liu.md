### Planned target:

1. Repair server MIC-GPU, purchase a GPU instance from Amazon, and apply Nvidia cluster from ImageNet
2. Contiune running and tuning ILSVRC 2012 model
3. Coursera: Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 1-2)
4. Paper review:
        Parallel Similarity Joins on Massive High-Dimensinal Data Using MapReduce

### Actual progress:
1.   [100%] repaired MIC-GPU, applied NVIDIA GPU
2.   [85%]  delivered data to MIC-GPU
2.   [100%] Done
3.   [100%] Done

### Remarks:
1.   ILSVRC compet: cuda-convnet2 provides interface to train ILSVRC 2012 data directly
2.   Searched market of large memory cluster
3.   inspired by similarity join paper, is that meanful to give approximate result during join processing?
