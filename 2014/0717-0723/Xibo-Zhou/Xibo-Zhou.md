### Planned target:
1. Find out what makes the CNN results different between UFLDL and DeepLearnToolBox
2. Try out deeplearning4j
3. Coursera: Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 1-2)
4. Paper review:
Parallel Similarity Joins on Massive High-Dimensinal Data Using MapReduce

### Actual progress:
1. [95%] The convoluted and pooled feature tables are the same
2. [0%]
3. [100%] Finished
4. [100%] Finished

### Remarks:
1. The runtime of CNN training(Toolbox plus UFLDL) is very long (> 3 hours). I am planning to try out setting CNN with all the feature table without dividing it like what UFLDL does.
2. The paper Alex published about implementing CNN on multiple gpu cores was presented by me in group meeting. The author has provided the CUDA code on their website.
