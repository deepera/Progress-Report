### Planned target: 
Hao:  
1. Contiune running and tuning ILSVRC 2012 model  
2. Try out cuda-convnet2 and other deep learning codes  
3. Coursera: Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 3-4)  
4. Paper reading:  
   	One Weird Trick for Parallelizing Convolutional Neural Networks  


### Actual progress:
1.   [50%] solved lot of things of cuda-convnet on Centos, but still remain some problems
2.   [30%] cuda-convnet2 adds more codes, and provides multi-GPU options, the core is similiar 
3.   [80%] course project 2 is ongoing
4.   [100%] Done

### Remarks:
1.   ILSVRC compet: re-preprocessed the data, now low work efficiency on centos 
2.   spent two days learnt GUI in python (wxython and pyqt4)
3.   4K seems limited to buy desktop for NVIDIA K40, how about 5K?
