## Name: Xibo Zhou

### Planned target: 
Hao:  
1. Complete the code of cross-validating between DeepLearnToolBox and UFLDL
2. Try out deeplearning4j
3. Coursera: Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 3-4)
4. Paper reading:
        One Weird Trick for Parallelizing Convolutional Neural Networks

### Actual progress:
1.   [95%] The two procedures I described before are indeed slightly different. Implementing both requires modification of toolbox
2.   [10%] Managed to execute the given example of AutoEncoder and RBM on a single machine
3.   [60%] Lecture and quiz finished, working on course project 2
4.   [100%] Done

### Remarks:
1.   The two procedures I described before are slightly different. Toolbox fit my first model well (different from UFLDL), but requires modification for the second model (same with UFLDL). The performance of the second model is better than the first. 
2.   It seems that Deeplearning4j has not included CNN. The ConvNet algorithm in Deeplearning4j uses RBM (Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine), and is still getting built out. In addition, the user experience is not pleasant.
3.   Attended HKJC meeting on July 21.
