### Planned target:
1. Learning how to use Git and Github to update progress report 
2. Contuniue composing patent technical report based on Xiaoying's thesis 
3. Read 4 papers related to trajectory compression

### Actual progress:
1. [95%] 
2. [90%] 
3. [85%] The four papers are: 
Georgios Kellaris, Nikos Pelekis, and Yannis Theodoridis. Map-matched trajectory
compression. Journal of Systems and Software, 86(6):1566-1579, 2013. 
Pablo Martinez Lerin, Daisuke Yamamoto, and Naohisa Takahashi. Encoding travel
traces by using road networks and routing algorithms. In Intelligent Interactive
Multimedia: Systems and Services, pages 233-243. Springer, 2012. 
John Edward Hershberger and Jack Snoeyink. Speeding up the Douglas-Peucker line-
simple Location algorithm. University of British Columbia, Department of Computer Science, 1992. 
Nirvana Meratnia and A Rolf. Spatiotemporal compression techniques for moving
point objects. In Advances in Database Technology-EDBT 2004, pages 765-782.
Springer, 2004.

### Remarks:
1. Still a lot to learn 
2. Still need correcting 
3. I don't think I understand every detail of the papers so I won't say it is a 100% job done.
